## Build Timeline ✅

### Estimated Hours:

| Phase | Hours | Components |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **P1: Foundation** | 8-10 | Setup, auth, DB, env config |
| **P2: Data Collection** | 18-22 | Import parser, OCR, conversation, references |
| **P3: Resume Gen** | 12-15 | Generator, ATS optimize, truth check |
| **P4: Output** | 10-12 | Editor, PDF, DOCX |

**Timeline Status**: Realistic and achievable ✅

---

## Risk Assessment ✅

### Technical Risks & Mitigations:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **OCR accuracy varies by format** | Medium | Medium | Test with 69 sample resumes, iterative prompt improvement |
| **Import parser misses data** | Medium | Medium | Conservative extraction (better to miss than hallucinate), user can review |
| **Truth check false positives** | Medium | High | Conservative flagging (only high-confidence issues), user can override |
| **WeasyPrint PDF formatting issues** | Low | Medium | Use tested HTML/CSS patterns, fallback to simpler layout |
| **Reference response rate low** | Medium | Low | Clear value proposition, easy 1-click link, follow-up reminders |

### Product Risks & Mitigations:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Users find truth check accusatory** | Medium | High | Frame as "editorial review" not "lie detector", empowering language |
| **Conversation feels robotic** | Low | Medium | Use Claude's conversational ability, dynamic follow-ups |
| **Knowledge base cluttered** | Medium | Low | Show last-used dates, archive old items, periodic cleanup |
| **Users don't request references** | High | Medium | Make it optional, show value ("Get validation from former managers"), easy templates |

**Overall Risk**: Low-Medium, well-mitigated ✅

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Final Content Prep (1-2 hours)
- Polish question bank (40 questions)
- Draft reference templates
- Create ATS system seed data

### Option 2: Start Build Immediately
- Use question bank draft as-is
- Refine during implementation
- Focus on core functionality first

### Recommended: **Option 2 - Start Building**

**Rationale**:
- Planning is thorough (98% ready)
- All blocking items resolved
- Content can be refined during build
- Sooner we start, sooner we validate

---

## Build Execution Plan

**When you're ready to start**, here's what I'll do:

**Step 1**: Create project structure
- Initialize backend (FastAPI)
- Initialize frontend (Next.js)
- Set up environment variables
- Configure Supabase connection

**Step 2**: Database migrations
- Create all 14 tables
- Set up indexes
- Seed ATS systems data
- Test MCP integration

**Step 3**: Build in phases (following MVP_SCOPE_FINAL.md)
- Phase 1: Foundation (auth, setup)
- Phase 2: Data collection (import, OCR, conversation, references)
- Phase 3: Resume generation (generator, truth check)
- Phase 4: Output (editor, PDF, DOCX)
- Phase 5: Deploy

**Step 4**: Test and deploy
- Integration testing
- Beta user testing
- Production deployment
- Documentation

**Estimated Time**: 55-60 focused hours

---

## Final Questions Before Build

1. **Database connection**: Use MCP (already configured) or get password for direct connection?
   - **Recommendation**: Use MCP - it's already working

2. **Question bank**: Use draft as-is or spend 1-2 hours polishing?
   - **Recommendation**: Use draft, refine during build

3. **Build approach**: All phases sequentially or test after each phase?
   - **Recommendation**: Test after each phase (safer)

4. **Deployment**: Deploy at end or deploy continuously?
   - **Recommendation**: Deploy at end of each phase (validate on production early)
