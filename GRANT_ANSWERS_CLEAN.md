RESUMAKER - Grant Application (Final - Formal Voice)
AI for Economic Opportunity Fund - Oct 31, 2025


1. PROJECT TITLE
Resumaker: AI-Powered Resume Builder for Underrepresented Job Seekers


2. PROJECT SUMMARY (<150 words)

A resume should tell a person's story. But most people—especially those from underrepresented backgrounds—don't love writing resumes. They struggle to translate lived experience into the language employers understand.

Resumaker works like being interviewed for a biography. Over 10-minute conversations (voice or text, in Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, or English), thoughtful questions draw out your authentic story: What did you build? What challenges did you overcome? Follow-up questions go deeper, like a journalist uncovering details.

The AI takes notes, captures the whole picture (like a thumbprint scanner—multiple touches to get it right), then translates your story into professional English. An AI fact-check helps you verify everything feels true to who you are and factually correct (no AI hallucinations). Canva-like design makes editing simple.

Time with Resumaker is about documenting your real accomplishments so you can show up as your best self and be a competitive applicant. The platform captures your career as it grows—some wins don't fit neatly on a traditional resume, but they matter to your story and shape who you become.


3. PROJECT LEADERSHIP

Evan Stoudt - Founder & Lead Developer

Leadership Experience
Founded and scaled Livingston Collegiate Academy from 1 to 75 staff, managing $8.5M budget and securing $600K+ in grants. Built coalition of 15+ workforce partners creating pathways for students from non-traditional backgrounds. Currently serve 5 education nonprofits with 15+ production systems deployed serving 600+ users.

Why This Project
I was a high school principal transitioning into tech. White male, under 40, strong resume. I still struggled to get interviews because my background didn't match traditional career paths. If it was that hard for me—someone with every structural advantage—imagine how much harder it is for people facing language barriers, name bias, or cultural discrimination. The resume system is broken for anyone who doesn't fit the mold. That's why this project exists.

Technical Background
Full-stack developer specializing in AI integration (Claude, Gemini), Next.js, Python, and database architecture. Proven track record shipping AI products from concept to production.


4. HOW AI/ML/LLMs ADVANCE PROJECT GOALS

Challenge
Traditional resume services cost $50-150/hour—out of reach for most low-wage workers. Multilingual career counselors who understand cultural differences in professional communication are nearly impossible to find at any price.

Discovery
AI changes the economics entirely. What costs $150 with a human counselor now costs $5 in API costs per user. AI can serve users in Spanish, Vietnamese, and Mandarin simultaneously while maintaining quality.

Technical Implementation

Large Language Models (Claude/Anthropic)
- Conversational interface that asks follow-up questions based on what you share
- Multi-language translation with cultural context preservation (Vietnamese "We achieved" becomes "Led team to achieve")
- Resume generation with ATS-compliant formatting for major platforms
- AI fact-check that cross-references claims against conversation transcripts

Optical Character Recognition (Gemini AI)
- Extracts structured data from uploaded resumes (PDF, DOCX, images)
- Migrates proven Car Talker codebase (90%+ accuracy parsing receipts)

Voice and Automation
- Multi-language voice recognition for hands-free resume creation
- Persistent knowledge base using semantic search (remembers your career story across sessions)
- Automated outcome tracking for impact measurement

Impact
Without AI, this model doesn't work. Human counselors cost $150/hour, can't scale one-on-one sessions, and multilingual expertise is unavailable. AI enables 95% cost reduction and simultaneous service in 7 languages—making the service accessible to the populations who need it most.


5. SCOPE OF WORK & MAJOR MILESTONES

90-Day Goal: Serve 500 job seekers, demonstrate 25% increase in job placement rates and 15% increase in starting salaries.

Weeks 1-3: Foundation & Infrastructure

- PDF and DOCX export functionality
- Reach 500 total users
Outcome: Resume generation functional for all major ATS platforms.


Weeks 10-13: Impact Measurement
- Collect outcome data (applications, interviews, placements, salaries)
- User satisfaction assessment and testimonials
- Impact analysis validating targets
- Demo Day preparation
Outcome: 500 users served, $1.875M estimated earnings increase, platform demonstration-ready.


Efficiency Comparison

Traditional services cost $300/user (counselor at $150/hour for 2 hours). AI costs $5/user—a 98% reduction. Human translators and fact-checkers are cost-prohibitive. AI enables multi-language support, truth verification, and persistent knowledge at scale. Bottom line: AI transforms a high-cost, low-scale, slow service into a low-cost, high-scale, fast platform accessible to underrepresented populations.


6. DATA SOURCES

Public Data Sources
- ATS optimization rules from public documentation (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Taleo, iCIMS) compiled into 2,350-line guide

We collect conversations about your career, uploaded resumes, job postings, and optional outcome data (applications, interviews, placements, salaries).

Storage & Security: Supabase (SOC 2 certified), AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, US-based servers.

User Ownership: You retain 100% ownership. Export all data anytime (PDF, CSV, JSON). One-click permanent deletion. Zero sharing with employers, government, or third parties. Revenue from user fees (sliding scale $0-20), not data sales. Your data never trains public AI models.

Compliance: GDPR and CCPA compliant. Immigration status never collected. Voice recordings deleted within 48 hours. Anonymous mode available.

Outcome Data: Collected via optional surveys and partner tracking. Aggregated reporting only—individual data never disclosed.

Key Principle: We are data stewards, not owners. You maintain full control with capability to export or delete at any time.


7. TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

Internal Technical Capacity

Evan Stoudt (Founder & Lead Developer)
- Full-stack development: Next.js, Python/FastAPI, Supabase
- AI integration: Claude API, Gemini API (proven in Car Talker project)
- Team leadership: Scaled organization from 1 to 75 staff, managed $8.5M budget
- Current work: 15+ production systems serving 600+ users across 5 nonprofits

Capability Assessment: Internal expertise sufficient for 90-day demonstration phase (500 users). Scaling phase (10K+ users) will benefit from advisory support in advanced NLP, production architecture, and security auditing.

Limitations Acknowledged: Advanced NLP techniques, production-scale AI architecture (100K+ concurrent users), multilingual NLP edge cases, AI security auditing.

External Advisory Support (Sought, Not Contracted)

1. AI/ML Technical Advisor: Expert in production AI systems, multilingual NLP, bias mitigation. Source: Grant cohort support, Anthropic community.

2. Workforce Development Expert: Career counselor with 10+ years experience to validate resume quality and impact measurement. Source: Pilot partner organizations.

3. Immigration & Language Access Expert: Culturally responsive design advisor for LEP communities. Translation review across 7 languages. Source: Migration Policy Institute, local immigrant service orgs.

Approach: Lean startup model. Solo founder handles initial development, leverages grant cohort support, recruits advisors via small stipends. No external consulting firm currently contracted. Internal expertise is sufficient for demonstration phase.


8. ETHICS AND BIAS

Core Problem
Traditional resume systems embed structural bias: language bias (non-native speakers penalized for grammar), name bias (identical resumes receive 50% fewer callbacks with "ethnic-sounding" names), cultural bias (US conventions favor assertive self-promotion conflicting with many cultural values), format bias (ATS penalizes creative layouts), and credential bias (degree requirements exclude equivalent skills from alternative pathways).

Mission: Center people of color, immigrants, and economically marginalized populations in design, ensuring AI empowers rather than replicates existing biases.

Key Concerns & Mitigation

AI Misrepresentation: AI fact-check cross-references every claim against conversation transcripts, flags mismatches for user review. User approval required before export. Philosophy: help people tell their truth better, not help them lie. Testing: Human reviewers verify claim accuracy, measure false positive rate.

Gender Bias: Harvard Gender Decoder integration, gender-neutral verb library, blind demographic testing (same experience, varied names). DEI consultant quarterly audits. Target: <5% gender-coded words, zero tone variance by perceived gender.

Racial Bias: A/B testing with same experience data and different demographic indicators. User-selected tone preference (not AI-assumed). Diverse training data. Advisory board from target communities. Target: Zero phrasing differences by race.

Cultural Bias: Cultural bridging approach (Vietnamese "We achieved" becomes "Led team to achieve") with user education on US expectations. Cultural advisors review translations. User choice: "culturally adapted" vs. "preserve original tone." Target: 90% user satisfaction with cultural respect.

Digital Divide: Partnership access at workforce centers (computers/internet provided), mobile-first design, low-bandwidth mode, offline capability, screen reader compatibility (WCAG 2.1 AA). Target: 95% of pilot users complete resume without technical barriers.

Economic Access: Sliding scale pricing ($0-20), organizational sponsorship, "pay it forward" model, free demonstration phase (500 users), public benefit corporation structure.

Privacy Concerns: Plain-language privacy policy in all supported languages, zero data sharing with government/employers/third parties, anonymous mode, community endorsement, immigration attorney review. Target: >80% of vulnerable populations feel "safe" using platform.

Testing Framework
Gender: Harvard Gender Decoder, demographic A/B tests, quarterly automated testing.
Racial: Name-based A/B testing, statistical consistency analysis.
Cultural: Advisor review, user satisfaction surveys.
Age: Automated age-coded language scanner.
AI Accuracy: 95% claim accuracy verified against conversation transcripts.

Ethical Principles
1. Design WITH marginalized communities, not FOR them
2. Transparency in AI functionality and data use
3. User agency—AI advises, user decides
4. Authentic over impressive
5. Privacy as default
6. Accessibility first

Ongoing Monitoring: Monthly bias audits, quarterly DEI consultant reviews, in-app bias reporting, advisory board meetings, continuous prompt engineering improvements.

Bottom Line: This project exists because AI can reduce bias in hiring—but only if bias mitigation is core architecture, not afterthought.


9. STAKEHOLDER DEFINITION

Who? Define your stakeholders

Our primary users are people from underrepresented backgrounds who face systemic barriers to economic opportunity—including first-generation college students, people of color, low-wage workers, immigrants, and long-term unemployed individuals. We serve users in their preferred language: Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Tagalog, Arabic, French, or Haitian Creole.


10. REACH & TIMELINE

How Many? Number reached and time period

500 job seekers over 90 days (demonstration phase)

Scaling phase: 10,000 users over 12 months through workforce development center partnerships


11. IMPACT OUTCOMES

What Impact? Specific outcomes and scale of change

Primary Outcome: Increased Income
Baseline: Low-wage workers in our target population average $25,000/year starting salary
With Resumaker: 15-20% increase in starting salaries
Impact per person: $3,000-5,000 additional annual earnings
500 users aggregate: $1.875 million in Year 1 earnings increase

Secondary Outcome: Job Placement Success
Baseline: Application-to-interview rate is ~5% for underrepresented job seekers
With Resumaker: 25% increase in application success (5% → 6.25%)
Long-term unemployed (12+ months): Break the "gap stigma" cycle. 40% of this subgroup secure placement within 90 days of resume creation, vs. baseline 15% placement rate. This population has often given up—getting them back in the game matters.

Tertiary Outcome: Time to Employment
Baseline: 6 months from active job search to placement for target population
With Resumaker: 30% reduction in time-to-employment (6 months → 4 months)
Impact: 2 months of additional earned income = $4,000-5,000 in their pocket sooner

Confidence & Self-Efficacy Outcome (Critical for Vulnerable Populations)
Baseline: 73% of immigrants and 68% of first-generation college students feel "unconfident" or "very unconfident" in their resume quality
With Resumaker: 85% of users report feeling "confident" or "very confident" in their resume after using platform
Long-term unemployed: 70% report "renewed confidence in job search" vs. baseline of 25% confidence after 12+ months unemployment. When you've been unemployed for a year, you start to believe the problem is you. A resume that accurately shows your value changes that internal narrative.
Measurement: Post-creation survey asking "Do you feel this resume accurately represents your value to employers?" and "How confident do you feel applying to jobs with this resume?"

Application Activity Outcome
Baseline: Users apply to 3 jobs per month on average (discouraged by resume quality concerns)
With Resumaker: 12 applications per month (4x increase in activity)
40% increase in applications to higher-wage positions—users feel qualified to "reach higher" instead of playing it safe


12. EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS

Change to an existing program? If the grant focuses on improving the efficiency or scale of an existing program

This is a new service, not an existing program improvement. But compared to traditional resume services:

Cost: Traditional services cost $150/hour for 2 hours = $300/user. Resumaker costs $5/user in API costs. That's a 98% cost reduction.

Accessibility: Traditional services serve English speakers only. Resumaker serves 7 languages simultaneously, unlocking access for 25 million LEP individuals previously excluded.

Scale: Traditional 1-on-1 counseling serves ~50 people per counselor per month. Resumaker serves thousands simultaneously—2000% scale increase per operational dollar.


IMPACT SUMMARY (COPY-PASTE READY)

We expect 500 job seekers from underrepresented backgrounds—particularly immigrants with limited English proficiency, people of color facing hiring bias, and workers unemployed for 12+ months—to experience the following outcomes over 90 days:

- Job placement improvement: 25% increase in application-to-interview success (5% → 6.25%)
- Income increase: 15-20% higher starting salaries, averaging $3,000-5,000 additional annual earnings per person
- Long-term unemployed breakthrough: 40% of users unemployed 12+ months will secure placement within 90 days (vs. 15% baseline)
- Confidence restoration: 85% report feeling confident in resume quality (vs. 27% baseline for target population)
- Application activity: 4x increase in monthly job applications (3 → 12 per month), with 40% increase in applications to higher-wage positions

Total aggregate economic impact: $1.875 million in Year 1 earnings increase for 500 users, with sustained confidence gains enabling continued career advancement.
