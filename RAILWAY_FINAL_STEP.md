# 🎯 Railway Deployment - ONE FINAL STEP

## ✅ What I Did (Complete):

1. ✅ Deployed your backend to Railway using your token
2. ✅ Build is processing now: https://railway.com/project/2ee9783a-289a-4c64-b40c-117d76844c91/service/24fe7a60-97f5-4874-86b1-a43a209fa6a0

## 🔧 What YOU Need to Do (30 seconds):

### Step 1: Open Railway Dashboard
👉 Click this link: https://railway.com/project/2ee9783a-289a-4c64-b40c-117d76844c91

### Step 2: Generate Domain
1. Click on your backend service (should show as "resumaker-backend")
2. Click the "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Domains" section
4. Click "Generate Domain" button
5. **Copy the URL** (looks like: `resumaker-backend-production.up.railway.app`)

### Step 3: Paste URL Here
Just paste that Railway URL in the chat and I'll:
- ✅ Update Vercel frontend environment variable
- ✅ Redeploy Vercel with permanent backend
- ✅ Give you the final permanent live URL
- ✅ No more 2-hour expiration!

## 🕐 While You Wait:

Your app is **still live** on the temporary ngrok URL:
🔗 https://resumaker-jgudtuoq4-evan-1154s-projects.vercel.app

Your friend can test it right now!

## ⚡ Why I Need You:

The Railway token you gave me can **deploy code** but can't **generate domains** (requires full admin permissions).

This is actually a GOOD security feature - deployment tokens shouldn't be able to change networking settings.

**Just paste the Railway domain URL here when you have it!**
