### Role Description
As a Senior Product Manager focused on new AI applications, you will lead the exploration, development and launch of an entirely new product line at MagicSchool. This is a highly entrepreneurial role where you will be responsible for both evaluating opportunities for new AI-powered products, and working cross functionally to build them. This is a "zero to one" role, perfect for a product manager who is comfortable with ambiguity, and is pragmatic in their approach to translate opportunities into high-impact products for educators and students.

### Responsibilities
In this role, you will be responsible for driving towards the following outcomes:

Evaluate, define and execute the product vision for a new AI-powered product in education.

Operate in a highly ambiguous environment, driving 0→1 innovation by rapidly testing, validating, and scaling new ideas.

Represent the voice of educators and students, balancing user needs with business goals in new AI-driven product lines.

Partner cross-functionally with engineering, design, marketing, and other stakeholders to bring new initiatives to life.

Build strong business cases for investment in AI initiatives, using data and research to prioritize effectively.

### Experience & Qualifications
To be successful in this role, you'll bring the following experience and qualifications:

5+ years of product management experience, with a proven track record in building and scaling 0→1 products with demonstrable user impact.

Deep understanding of AI technologies and applications, ideally with direct experience building consumer-facing AI products such as chatbots, agents, workflows, multimodal, multimedia, etc.

Comfort navigating ambiguity, with founder/early builder experience strongly preferred.

Strong cross-functional collaboration skills; able to communicate persuasively with engineering, design, marketing, legal, and finance.

Proficiency in using data (qualitative and quantitative) to inform product decisions and measure success.

Excellent execution skills: ability to balance long-term vision with fast iteration in a high-growth environment.

**Nice to have:**

Passion for education and prior EdTech experience

Strong experience building and launching AI-powered applications and features

### Our Values:

**Educators are Magic:** Educators are the most important ingredient in the educational process - they are the magic, not the AI. Trust them, empower them, and put them at the center of leading change in service of students and families.

**Joy and Magic:** Bring joy and magic into every learning experience - push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

**Community:** Foster community that supports one another during a time of rapid technological change. Listen to them and serve their needs.

**Innovation:** The education system is outdated and in need of innovation and change - AI is an opportunity to bring equity, access, and serve the individual needs of students better than we ever have before.

**Responsibility:** Put responsibility and safety at the forefront of the technological change that AI is bringing to education.

**Diversity:** Diversity of thought, perspectives, and backgrounds helps us serve the wide audience of educators and students around the world.
