**Status**: ✅ APPROVED BY EVAN
**Scope**: Build entire Resumaker MVP (all 105 tasks, all 5 phases)

---

## ✅ FULL AUTHORIZATION GRANTED

Evan has granted **COMPLETE AUTONOMY** to build Resumaker from start to finish.

### What This Means:

**I WILL BUILD EVERYTHING WITHOUT ASKING:**
- ✅ All 5 phases (Foundation → Data Collection → Resume Gen → Output → Deploy)
- ✅ All 105 tasks autonomously
- ✅ Fix all errors (try 3 solutions before reporting)
- ✅ Make all technical decisions
- ✅ Install any packages needed
- ✅ Create all files and folders
- ✅ Write all migrations
- ✅ Build all features
- ✅ Refactor and optimize
- ✅ Write tests
- ✅ Commit to git (local only)
- ✅ Document everything

**I WILL ONLY STOP FOR:**
- ❌ True blockers (after 3 failed fix attempts)
- ❌ Scope changes (features not in MVP_SCOPE_FINAL.md)
- ❌ Cost decisions (paid services)
- ❌ Security issues requiring user decision

**I WILL CHECK IN:**
- 📊 At end of each phase with summary
- 🚨 If truly blocked after exhausting all solutions
- ✅ When MVP is 100% complete
