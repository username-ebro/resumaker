## Key Innovations

### Truth Check Workflow
```
User completes conversation
  ‚Üì
AI generates resume draft
  ‚Üì
Truth Serum Analysis
  ‚Üì
System flags 3-10 items for verification:
  ‚Ä¢ "You mentioned growth but didn't specify 150% - confirm?"
  ‚Ä¢ "You discussed Python but not C++ - remove or add context?"
  ‚Ä¢ "Team size not mentioned - what was actual size?"
  ‚Üì
User confirms/corrects each flag
  ‚Üì
Final resume generated with verified data only
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents users from accidentally lying
- Builds confidence in resume accuracy
- Differentiates from "just make it sound good" AI tools
- Ethical AI in action

### Knowledge Base Architecture
```
First Visit (New User):
- Extensive 30-45 min conversation
- Extract 20-40 knowledge items
- Store: accomplishments, skills, stories, metrics

Return Visit (1 year later):
- "Last time you mentioned leading a team of 15 - still relevant?"
- "You had 3 years at TechCorp - any updates?"
- Build new resume in 10-15 minutes using existing knowledge
- Add only new accomplishments since last visit

Benefits:
- Faster resume generation on return
- Consistent data across multiple resumes
- Historical record of career progression
- Cover letters pull from same knowledge base
```

### Smart Import Parser
```
User: [Pastes entire ChatGPT conversation about resume]

System analyzes conversation:
- Detects 15 accomplishments mentioned
- Extracts 8 skills discussed
- Identifies 3 detailed stories
- Finds 12 quantitative metrics
- Notes 2 certifications

System: "I found all this information. Ready to build your resume?"

User: "Yes!"

System: [Generates resume in 2 minutes using imported data]
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **OCR accuracy on varied resume formats**
   - Mitigation: Test with 69 sample resumes, iteratively improve prompts

2. **Translation quality for non-English input**
   - Mitigation: Claude is strong at translation, add quality scores, allow human review

3. **Truth checker false positives (flagging valid claims)**
   - Mitigation: Conservative flagging (only flag when confidence < 0.5), user can override

4. **Voice recognition accuracy across accents**
   - Mitigation: Start with Web Speech API, upgrade to Deepgram/Whisper if needed

### Product Risks:
1. **Users feel interrogated by truth check**
   - Mitigation: Frame as "editorial fact-check", not accusatory, empowering language

2. **Conversation flow feels robotic**
   - Mitigation: Use Claude's conversational abilities, dynamic follow-ups, natural language

3. **Knowledge base becomes cluttered/outdated**
   - Mitigation: Show last-used date, allow archiving, periodic cleanup prompts

## Next Steps

### Before Build:
1. ‚úÖ Planning complete (PROJECT_VISION_V2, BUILD_PLAN_V2)
2. ‚è≥ Create Supabase project

6. ‚è≥ Draft initial question bank (English)

### Build Execution:
- **Approach**: One-shot build following BUILD_PLAN_V2.md
- **Duration**: 50-60 focused hours
- **Method**: Provide comprehensive prompt with all specifications
- **Checkpoints**: Test after each priority phase (P0, P1, P2, etc.)

### Post-Build:
- Beta testing with 5-10 users
- Collect feedback on truth check UX
- Refine conversation flow
- Add additional languages if needed
- Iterate on translation quality

## Questions for Decision

### Before Starting Build:

1. **Language Priority**: Should multi-language support be P0 (must-have for MVP) or P1 (add after core works)?
   - **Recommendation**: P0 - It's a core differentiator, but start with just 1-2 languages (Spanish + English)

2. **Import Parser Priority**: Is ChatGPT/Claude import critical for MVP or nice-to-have?
   - **Recommendation**: P1 - Valuable but not blocking. Users can still do full conversation without it.

3. **Visual Editor Complexity**: Full drag-and-drop editor or simple preview + text edit?
   - **Recommendation**: Simple for MVP - Preview with section-by-section editing, not full WYSIWYG

4. **Truth Check Aggressiveness**: Should we flag conservatively (fewer flags, high confidence) or liberally (more flags, catch everything)?
   - **Recommendation**: Conservative for MVP - Better to miss a few than overwhelm users with false positives

## Domain Name Ideas

Since `resumaker.ai` is taken, alternatives:

- `resumetruth.ai` (emphasizes truth-checking)
- `truthfulresume.com`
- `voiceresume.ai` (emphasizes conversational approach)
- `resumemaker.io` (classic, may be available)
- `getresumaker.com` (fallback)
- `resumebuilder.ai` (generic but clear)
- `storyresume.com` (emphasizes Storyworth approach)
- `myresumaker.com`

**Decision**: Can wait until post-MVP, use localhost for development

## Conclusion

Resumaker solves a real problem (hard to create competitive resumes, especially for non-traditional candidates) with a unique approach (conversational, truthful, inclusive, persistent).

The technical plan is comprehensive, the assets are available, and the scope is well-defined.

**We're ready to build.** üöÄ
